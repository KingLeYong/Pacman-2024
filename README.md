# PACMAN JAVASCRIPT PROJECT

Welcome to my first GitHub javascript project! This is a beginner-friendly animation of Pac-Man using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In this project, I've created a simple Pac-Man character that moves across the screen, simulating the classic arcade animation.

## Languages

- HTML Structure: Sets up the basic layout and elements needed for the Pac-Man animation.
- CSS Styling: Creates Pac-Man's look and feel, with a simple animation effect to mimic his chomping movement.
- JavaScript Logic: Manages Pac-Manâ€™s movement and the animation loop to keep him "eating" along the screen.
